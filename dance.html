        I've been teaching partner dance since 2021 in Philadelphia, and now
        teach out of a private practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I particularly love helping people who are new to dance and helping them
        connect to the music, their partner, and themselves :) Dancing is such a
        rewarding activity, a challenging skill, and something to work on no
        matter what age or ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        My students are both singles and couples; I love helping leaders gain
        confidence and couples taking time to connect with each other.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the dances I teach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Argentine Tango</li>
        <li>Swing (East and West Coast)</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
        <li>Bachata</li>
        <li>American Ballroom: Waltz, Foxtrot, Tango, Rumba …</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not sure where to start? No problem! I love introducing folks to dance
        and we discover where your passions lie!
      </p>
