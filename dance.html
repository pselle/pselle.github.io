            I've been teaching partner dance since 2021 in Philadelphia, and
            teach out of a private studio located in East Passyunk.
          </p>
          <p>
            I particularly love helping people who are new to dance and helping
            them connect to the music, their partner, and themselves :) Dancing
            is such a rewarding activity, a challenging skill, and something to
            work on no matter what age or ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            My students are both singles and couples; I love helping leaders
            gain confidence and couples taking time to connect with each other.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the dances I teach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Argentine Tango</li>
            <li>Swing (East and West Coast)</li>
            <li>Salsa</li>
            <li>Bachata</li>
            <li>American Ballroom: Waltz, Foxtrot, Tango, Rumba …</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Not sure where to start? No problem! I love introducing folks to
            dance and we discover where your passions lie!
